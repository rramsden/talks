Distributed Rate Limiting
=========================

Talk Abstract
-------------

Imagine if you were left alone in the dark, with monsters everywhere. That's a bit like distributed computing.
Servers simply vanish without a trace. Power failures, broken hardware, people tripping over cables, you name it.
The cloud is very scary place. Creating algorithms for the distributed world requires you to account for all sorts of
crazy problems. In my talk I will be covering the work I've been doing with rate limiting algorithms in distributed systems.
More specifically, I will talk about the design process and challenges I faced creating and implementing
an algorithm for the cloud.
